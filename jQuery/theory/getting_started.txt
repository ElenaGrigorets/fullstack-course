You can download jQuery from here: https://jquery.com/download/
Always include the jQuery file before your custom scripts
jQuery's CDN:
<script src="https://code.jquery.com/jquery-3.5.1.min.js"></script>

Syntax:  $(selector).action();
In jQuery, the dollar sign ($) is just an alias for jQuery.
<script>
    $(document).ready(function(){
        // Some code to be executed...
        alert("Hello World!");
    });
</script>
Note: You should place the jQuery code inside the document ready event
      so that your code executes when the document is ready to be worked on.
